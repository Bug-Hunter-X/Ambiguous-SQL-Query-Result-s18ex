This repository demonstrates a common SQL query error related to ambiguity. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that can return unexpected results due to the lack of a unique identifier and the use of `SELECT *`. The `solution.sql` file provides a corrected query.  Always use a unique key for identifying records and explicitly select columns to avoid such issues. Read the content of the files for more details.
